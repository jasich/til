# Situation Behavior Impact

When addressing an issue with someone present the issues in this format as it makes the issue less personal.

Example:

Instead of saying "Late again?  Please try to be on-time to meetings" you could say "For our big presentation (situation) you were late (behavior) which make everyone feel like you didn't care (impact)."
